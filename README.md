CLCNet: a contrastive learning and chromosome-aware network for genomic prediction in plants

Genomic Selection (GS) is a breeding technology that predicts breeding values and phenotypes of candidate populations using genomic markers and phenotypic data. Its core lies in constructing accurate genomic prediction (GP) models. Traditional GP models face limitations in capturing complex genetic architectures. To address this, we developed a deep learning model, Contrastive learning and chromosome-aware Network (CLCNet), specifically designed for plant genomic prediction. CLCNet integrates two key modules: a contrastive learning module to capture phenotypic differences and a chromosome-aware module that considers linkage effects, local epistasis, and global epistasis. This design effectively selects representative markers, reduces data noise, and improves predictive performance.
