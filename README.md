# CLCNet
CLCNet: a contrastive learning and chromosome-aware network for genomic prediction in plants

Conventional GP models often struggle to capture inter-individual variability and are particularly challenged by the "curse of dimensionality". We proposed CLCNet, a novel deep learning framework that integrates multi-task learning with contrastive learning for GP. CLCNet consists of two key components: 

(i) a contrastive learning module, designed to enhance the modelâ€™s ability to capture fine-grained genotype-dependent phenotypic differences across individuals; 

(ii) a chromosome-aware module, which performs feature selection at both the chromosome level and genome-wide level to retain the most informative SNPs.
